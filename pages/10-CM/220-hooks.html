Hooks in CM are bracketed sections of code that allow the CM engine &quot;hook into&quot; the text and do some processing. Hooks are delimited by ~\{~ and ~\}~. Hooks in CM are of three kinds:

* {:Typographical hooks|cm_typography}.
* {:Formatting hooks|cm_text}.
* Processing hooks. Processing hooks implement {:.lc cm_links}, {:.lc cm_images}, and {:.lc cm_notes}.

A processing hook has, immediately after the opening {~\{}, a specific /tag/, optionally followed by arguments (&quot;parts&quot;) of a hook: the first one separated from the tag by a blank space; the following parts separated by {~\|}.

Each book may implement its own processing hooks (in ~books.js~).
