A line that starts with ~#~ in the first position is a comment and will be ignored.

The CM source text:
~~~
A normal line
# This is a comment

 # This is not a comment
 
This is also # not a comment
~~~
will be rendered as {&gt;}
---.box
A normal line
# This is a comment

 # This is not a comment
 
This is also # not a comment
---

If ~#~ must be in the first position, {:escape|cm_escape} it:
~~~
\# Hash sign in the first position
~~~
makes {&gt;}
---.box
\# Hash sign in the first position
---
