= Fenced sections

Exactly three ~-~ in the first position indicate the beginning or ending of a /fenced/ section block. The ~---~ may be followed by a section tag and by class attributes. The choice of section tags should correspond to {:HTML block-level elements|https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp}. Sections may be nested.

~---~ that is not followed by a section tag indicates a section ending, if inside of a section; otherwise it indicates a section beginning and the tag ~div~ is assumed (which is usually the common case).

==== Boxes
Boxes are ~div~ sections with the class attribute ~.box~.

== Code blocks

Exactly three {~~} in the first position on a line delimit a code block (pre-formatted text). The opening {~~~~} may be followed by class attributes.

Code blocks may *not* be nested. The content of a code block is highlighted as a specific programming language (given by the class attribute) by {:https://highlightjs.org/}.

The text in a code block is interpreted literally and no markup processing takes place, with the exception of {~~~~} that end the code block.
